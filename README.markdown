_Managing Windows Better_

XFCE doesn't provide a window manager key to switch back to the last
(alternate) desktop you just switched from. These scripts provide this missing
functionality. Disable your workspace switching keys in `xfwm4-settings` and
use `xfce4-keyboard-settings` to bind these scripts to your preferred window
switching keys.
